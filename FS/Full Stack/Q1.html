        <h1>10 Places to visit in Pune</h1>
        <p>1.SHIVNERI FORT was the birthplace of SHIVAJI MAHARAJ, the great MARATHA EMPEROR. It was here that he got his early training tto get him ready for his future role as the undisputed King of the MARATHA dynasty. The fort is situated on a hill that is 300 meter tall. One has to cross seven gates to reach the fort, which highlights how well the fort was guarded.</p>
        <p>2.RAJGAD FORT , At a height of 4600 feet stands RAJGAD FORT, which served as SHIVAJI'S capital for more than 25 years. Treakking Rajgad can be a memorable experience as it is highly adventurous. The views from the top are stunning. To do justice to yourself and the fort after having treakked so high, it would be a better idea to camp here overnight so that you can throughly explore the fort the following morning. The fort houses two temples where camping facilities are provided.
