The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a well-known design
 pattern in the web development field.

 What is MVC architecture in Java?
The model designs based on the MVC architecture follow MVC design pattern.
 The application logic is separated from the user interface while designing 
 the software using model designs.

The MVC pattern architecture consists of three layers:
Model: It represents the business layer of application. 
It is an object to carry the data that can also contain the logic 
to update controller if data is changed.
View: It represents the presentation layer of application. 
It is used to visualize the data that the model contains.
Controller: It works on both the model and view. 
It is used to manage the flow of application, i.e. data flow in the model object and to update the view whenever 
data is changed.
